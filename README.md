# e-Piano
A virtual simulated Python program where notes of piano are passed as an argument and an output audio (in .wav file) is produced

Basic Anatomy of Piano:
A piano consists of multiple octaves
1 octave = 7 white keys + 5 black keys

Nomenclature of Piano keys:
White keys: C, D, E, F, G, A, B
Black keys: Named wrt the relative position with an adjacent white key
            b: Flat (if a black key is present on the left of the white key)
            #: Sharp (if a black key is present on the right side of the white key)

Our notation: White keys would be denoted as usual but black keys would be identified as sharp keys and would be denoted as corresponding white keys in lower case.
